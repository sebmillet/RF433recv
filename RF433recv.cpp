  Schematic

  1. Arduino board. Tested with NANO and UNO.
  2. Radio Frequence 433Mhz RECEIVER like MX-RM-5V.

  RF433 RECEIVER data pin must be plugged on a board' digital PIN that can
  trigger interrupts, that is, D2 or D3.
  This RECEIVER PIN is defined at the time a 'Track' object is created. This
  library does not set it at compile time.
  See file schema.fzz (Fritzing format) or schema.png, for a circuit example
  with receiver plugged on D2.

**About the classes Band, Rail and Track**

1. About none of these - the signal as we see it.

The Radio-Frequence signal is supposed to be OOK (On-Off Keying), and
auto-synchronized.

The signal is a succession of low signal and high signal, low when no RF signal
received, high when a RF signal is received.
The coding relies on durations being either 'short' or 'long', and sometimes
much longer (to initialize, and to separate signal pieces).

The durations can be one of:
    - short
    - long, typically, twice as long as short
    - separator, much longer than the long one (at least 3 or 4 times longer)
    - initialization, at least as long as the separator, often much longer. It
      serves to make receiver ready to receive coded signal to come.

A signal structure is as follows:
    1. Initialization (very long high signal)
    2. Succession of low and high signals being 'short' or 'long'
    3. Separator (high signal)
    4. Possibly, repetition of steps 2 and 3

The succession of 'short' and 'long' is then decoded into original data, either
based on tri-bit scheme (inverted or not), or, Manchester.

Note that there can be complexities:

- After the long initialization high signal, addition of 'intermediate' prefix
  to the signal (longer than 'long', but shorter than 'separator'). Seen on a
  NICE FLO/R telecommand (/R means Rolling Code), while not seen on NICE FLO
  (fix code). The author guesses this prefix serves to let the receiver know the
  signal to come is FLO/R instead of FLO.

- After the long initialization high signal, succession of {low=short,
  high=short} followed by a separator. This serves as a synchronization
  sequence.

- While most protocols use same lengths for low and high signals, on NICE FLO/R
  this rule is not met, that is: the 'short' and 'long' durations of the low
  signal are different from 'short' and 'long' durations of the high signal.

2. About Rail

The Rail manages the succession of durations for one, and only one, of signal
realms (low or high).

That is, if you note dow the signal as usually (by line, one low followed by one
high):
      LOW, HIGH
      150,  200
      145,  400
      290,  195
        ...

Then the values below LOW (150, 145, 290, ...) are one Rail, and the values
below HIGH (200, 400, 195, ...) are another Rail.

3. About Bands

A band aims to categorize a duration, short or long. Therefore, a Rail is made
of 2 bands, one for the short duration, one for the long duration.

4. About Tracks

Rails live their own live but at some point, they must work in conjunction
(start and stop together, and provide final decoded values). This is the purpose
of a Track, that is made of 2 Rails.

In the end, a Track provides a convenient interface to the caller.

5. Overall schema

track ->  r_low  ->  b_short = manage short duration on LOW signal
      |          `-> b_long  = manage long duration on LOW signal
      |
      `-> r_high ->  b_short = manage short duration on HIGH signal
                 `-> b_long  = manage long duration on HIGH signal
